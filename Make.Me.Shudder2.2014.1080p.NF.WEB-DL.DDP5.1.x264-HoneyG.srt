00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,440
THIS FILM AIMS TO DEPICT THE LOVE
BETWEEN MAE NAK AND MAK

2
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,560
THROUGH MODERN DAY TEENAGED-CHARACTERS.

3
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,640
WE DO NOT INTEND TO SHOW ANY DISRESPECT
TO THE BELIEF AND WE APOLOGIZE IF WE DID.

4
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,360
Finally! Graduation!

5
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,640
The secondary school life was so dull.

6
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,360
Graduation, my ass.
How will you graduate, Nick?

7
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,760
What are you saying, Biew?

8
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,440
Look, three zeroes this semester.

9
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,320
I have two zeroes,
and two incomplete courses.

10
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,160
I also have one.

11
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,520
What the hell are you complaining for?

12
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,440
Well, you're so smart, Nick.

13
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,120
Three zeroes,

14
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,520
-two incomplete courses.
-There's more.

15
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,800
Not allowed to take two examinations.
How cool is that?

16
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,440
-How are we supposed to graduate?
-Hey.

17
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,320
If we want to graduate,
we should rely on mysticism.

18
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,440
I have a friend,
though he went to a Buddhist school,

19
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,720
he wished for studying abroad

20
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,320
and it actually came true.

21
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,240
-Where?
-Nick.

22
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,640
I'm just asking. I'm not going.

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,040
Oil. You believe this kind of shit?

24
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,160
Are you going then?

25
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,920
-Yes.
-Biew!

26
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,240
Nick! Nick! Nick.

27
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,800
Jam. Where's James?

28
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,840
James asked me to bring you this.

29
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,320
Here, take it.

30
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,280
Where did James go?

31
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,720
He went abroad.

32
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,480
When did he go?

33
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,080
He went this morning.

34
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,160
-When will he come back?
-Just text him and ask him.

35
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,120
He gets on my nerves just like James.

36
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,680
-Are you guys going or not?
-Let's go...

37
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,520
Let's go...

38
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,880
Hey, Brian,

39
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,240
Net, both of you're with them?

40
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,320
Must have a lot of free time.

41
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,640
Brian, hurry.

42
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,520
-Want a piggyback ride?
-Are you crazy?

43
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,080
Hey, I'm coming with you.

44
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,760
Who the hell are you?

45
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,240
I'm your friend.

46
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,920
What friend?

47
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,560
I've never seen him.

48
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,720
My name is Tong

49
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,800
from M. 6/6.

50
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,680
M. 6/6, my ass! We're from M. 6/5.

51
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,640
You punk.

52
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,520
Let's go.

53
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,160
Hey, man. I'm really from M. 6/6.

54
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,160
M. 6/6, my ass! I'm from M. 6/5.

55
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,040
-I just wanna come along.
-Stop talking.

56
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,800
Hurry up, kids.

57
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,200
Hurry up, Brian.

58
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,240
Kawao, is this where you made a wish?

59
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:57,240
Yes, this is where I made a wish.

60
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:03,360
Before I took my exam, I wished
I would win a scholarship to go abroad.

61
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,920
Go to abroad, you know?

62
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,960
And then...

63
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,240
After I made a wish...

64
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,720
I can go abroad.

65
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,320
Really sacred.

66
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,000
Shrine of Mae Nak Phra Khanong.

67
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,840
When you made a wish,
what did you offer?

68
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,400
I buy her clothes,

69
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,200
Thai dresses, for her and a son.

70
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,000
You know? Children.

71
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,160
You're talking gibberish.

72
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,280
Here, I'll translate.

73
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,480
He said when he prayed

74
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,440
he came with his mom
who wore a dress, a Thai dress.

75
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,920
And the children... didn't wear anything.

76
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,240
-Is that right?
-No. No. You're so stupid.

77
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,320
Why am I stupid?

78
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,960
Stop fighting. You're both stupid.

79
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,560
-This is bullshit.
-Just find some candles and joss sticks.

80
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,160
Then we can rush home.

81
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,800
Biew.

82
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,240
Biew!

83
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,920
-Go get the joss sticks.
-Why has it got to be me?

84
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,680
Because it's you.
I wouldn't use anyone else.

85
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,040
What's the matter with you?

86
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,480
Sorry, buddy.

87
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,960
Damn Nick.

88
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,160
Always using me.

89
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,560
Mae Nak...

90
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,840
Where are the joss sticks?

91
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,960
-Biew!
-Biew...

92
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,600
Biew.

93
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,280
What's the matter with you?

94
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,800
Behind you!

95
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,880
-What is it?
-Behind...

96
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,240
James! How'd you get here?

97
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,000
Hey, Nick!

98
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,800
I came to pray to Mae Nak.
Look at my grades.

99
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,160
Wow. Eight zeroes.

100
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,880
Not allowed to take four exams.

101
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,080
-I'm really lost, man.
-Jam.

102
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,800
-You said James went abroad.
-James told me that this morning.

103
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,080
You daft little brother.

104
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,200
Don't you know my personality?

105
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,080
You always ask me every morning
where I'm going,

106
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,360
so I was just being sarcastic.

107
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,440
Hey, Jam.

108
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,080
-Where are my bangs?
-It's there.

109
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,240
Why'd you take it?

110
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,560
Here.

111
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,520
-Didn't know you liked it.
-Hey.

112
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,800
We should go now.

113
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,440
Stop arguing.

114
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,680
Biew, where are the joss sticks?

115
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,400
Joss sticks...

116
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,000
There they are.

117
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,520
Shit!

118
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,440
Nick!

119
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,720
-You're causing trouble again.
-Just leave it.

120
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,480
THE SHRINE OF MAE NAK PHRA KHANONG

121
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,480
<i>Are you real, Mae Nak?</i>
<i>I've seen many people come here.</i>

122
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,040
<i>Did their wishes come true?</i>

123
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,720
<i>If you're real,</i>
<i>show us a miracle.</i>

124
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,720
<i>Or maybe just show yourself.</i>

125
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,560
<i>Come on. Show yourself!</i>

126
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,160
What's going on?

127
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,560
<i>Show yourself.</i>

128
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,680
Nick!

129
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,840
<i>Show yourself, Mae Nak.</i>

130
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,840
Nick! Nick!

131
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,760
<i>Mae Nak!</i>

132
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,080
Nick! Nick! Nick...

133
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,160
-Nick!
-Nick! What happened?

134
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,120
Nick.

135
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,000
Nick.

136
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,120
Nick.

137
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,680
-Wake up.
-Nick.

138
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,040
-Come to your senses, Nick.
-Is he sick?

139
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:24,960
Nick.

140
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,160
Nick. Nick. Nick.

141
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,080
Nick.

142
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,360
-What the hell!
-Let's go!

143
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,440
-Where the hell are you going?
-Follow me.

144
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,520
-Fine. Let's go.
-Let's just follow him.

145
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,840
-Where are you going, Nick?
-Don't ask. You'll see.

146
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,880
And how are you going?

147
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,160
Where are you going?

148
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,240
There!

149
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,760
-How did the boat get here?
-Where did it come from?

150
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,400
-What boat is it?
-Where's the boatman?

151
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,000
It's a big boat.

152
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,120
Where's the boatman?

153
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,320
How did it get here?

154
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,320
Aren't you two coming with me?

155
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,600
Where are you going?

156
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,000
James.

157
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,240
-Do you love me?
-Yeah, I love you, buddy.

158
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,160
How about you, Biew? Do you love me?

159
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,320
Yes... but I'm not going
with you this time

160
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,120
because last time
I nearly died because of you.

161
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,800
Because of me? You guys played a part too.

162
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,680
James, are you going with him?

163
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,240
-No.
-Who are you going with?

164
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,440
With him...
With you.

165
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,480
James, my buddy...

166
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,440
-Let's go.
-Nick, I gotta go. Please understand me.

167
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,640
James, my buddy...

168
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,240
What about you, guys?

169
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,240
-Do you love me?
-Yes.

170
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,280
-Will you come with me or go with them?
-Go with them.

171
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,080
Shit. No one's coming with me?

172
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,120
That's it, Nick.
I'm not following you anymore.

173
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,800
I'll be the master of my own destiny.

174
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,320
Remember this, James,
I won't be Nick's puppy dog anymore.

175
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,360
Good! You and I are besties.

176
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,760
From now on, no matter what,
I, James, will never abandon you.

177
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,640
Biew, my buddy, let's go.

178
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,000
Biew!

179
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,280
-I'm gone!
-What's the matter with you?

180
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,800
Damn James!
You said you'd never abandon me!

181
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,840
Big, why did you call me?
Have you finished the routine?

182
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,320
Yes, I have.

183
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,880
-Let's go. I'm scared.
-Where's my uniform?

184
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,280
It's in the car. I put it away for you.

185
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,880
Why did you come so late at night?

186
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,360
-I had to fulfill my vows.
-I saw a dog taking your shoes.

187
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,440
-Nick!
-James, my buddy.

188
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,240
You and I are besties.

189
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:19,120
From now on, no matter what,
I, James, will never abandon you.

190
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,120
Nick, my buddy.

191
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,440
-Come with me, James, my buddy.
-Let's go.

192
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:28,320
-Let's go. Come on in.
-Let's go...

193
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,600
Wait. Wait for me.

194
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,520
Nick, you and I are besties.

195
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,160
From now on, no matter what,
I, Biew, will never abandon you.

196
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,320
Come, Biew, my buddy.

197
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,040
Nick, my buddy, let's go.

198
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,800
Gawao, are you coming with me?

199
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:54,360
I don't like you, and I don't love you,
so why should I go with you guys?

200
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,600
I don't care if you love me or not,
just come with me.

201
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,320
Come on, Gawao. Hurry up.

202
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,080
Gawao, come quickly.
Quit wasting time.

203
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,080
Hurry up.

204
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,080
Who's going to paddle?

205
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,840
-You paddle.
-You paddle.

206
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,120
Biew.

207
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,440
Do you love me?

208
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,280
-Yes.
-How about you, James?

209
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,400
-Yeah, yeah. I do.
-How about you, guys?

210
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,760
Nope.

211
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,840
-Then the two of you paddle.
-What?

212
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,120
-Me, James?
-Yes.

213
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,040
-Me too?
-Yes, Biew.

214
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,200
-Let's go.
-Paddle.

215
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,920
-How, Biew?
-I also don't know how to paddle.

216
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
-Just go ahead and paddle.
-Hurry.

217
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,320
-Nick.
-What?

218
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,720
I love you, man...

219
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,640
but...

220
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,400
-can I ask you something?
-Sure.

221
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,120
I also have a question, James, my buddy.

222
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,320
So...

223
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,400
where the hell are you taking us?

224
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:34,240
Just paddle.
You'll know once we get there.

225
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:38,720
-Why do you have to ask?
-I just want to know where we're heading.

226
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,400
-The atmosphere is so scary.
-What are you whining about?

227
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,200
-What's that smell?
-What is it?

228
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,920
Stinks like a corpse, Biew.

229
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,000
Is it though?

230
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,880
-Betel palm.
-It's probably nothing.

231
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,480
Nick, is it much further?

232
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,880
I think we're almost there.

233
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,640
-You've been here before?
-No. I'm just guessing.

234
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,360
Man! I'm tired from paddling.

235
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,120
Just keep paddling.

236
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,800
Shit!

237
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,360
What the hell?

238
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,040
How did they get here?

239
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,880
I think it's just around the river bend.

240
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,560
-Hurry up, James, my buddy.
-Let's go!

241
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,960
-Let's help.
-Come on.

242
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,360
Net. Brian. Paddle faster.

243
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,800
I better not see anyone slacking off.

244
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,640
Hurry...

245
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,800
There it is! We're here.

246
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,120
Whose house is that?

247
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,680
I don't know either,
but something made me come here.

248
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:06,160
-Nick, I know who made you come here.
-Who?

249
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,160
It's... your dad!

250
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,240
I'll get you back for that, James,
my buddy.

251
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,120
Don't forget that.

252
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,520
Why have we still not reached the port?

253
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,600
-Biew, you--
-James, hold it.

254
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,080
Okay.

255
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,200
-Quick. Hold it.
-Let's go.

256
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,360
Me first.

257
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,240
-Nick, Hurry.
-Yeah, yeah.

258
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,360
Nick, hurry up.
Biew, you hurry up too.

259
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,080
Let's go, quick.

260
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,840
Hurry up.

261
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,240
-Careful, Jam.
-What are you doing?

262
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,120
Don't fall into the water.

263
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,880
Lizard!

264
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,920
Nick! Lizard.

265
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,560
-Nick! Lizard.
-Nick!

266
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,120
-Lizard...
-Scram!

267
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,120
-Biew. Lizard.
-You dare look at me!

268
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,680
-James!
-Scram!

269
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,440
-Scram!
-Just stab it.

270
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,600
Scram, or I'll stab you!

271
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,240
-Not yet!
-Scram!

272
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,080
Scram! I said scram!

273
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,840
Shit!

274
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,200
There are so many fucking lizards here...

275
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,760
-both in front of me and behind me.
-James, you asshole!

276
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,120
Potty mouth!

277
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,800
Whose house is this?

278
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,520
-So eerie.
-I say we go up and see.

279
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,760
You want to go up?

280
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,280
Of course. We're here.

281
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,240
Let's go.

282
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,200
-Tape.
-What do you want?

283
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,680
-I have to go.
-You need to take a shit right now?

284
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:30,160
-Can I just go here?
-You need to shit or are you chicken?

285
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,200
I need to shit. I can't wait anymore.

286
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,960
Wait for us!

287
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,080
Why does Tong have to go at this time?

288
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,120
-Jam, did you do that on purpose?
-How could I?

289
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,600
Let's go.

290
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,520
What's the matter with you?

291
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,320
-You're really going up, Nick?
-Of course!

292
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,800
Let's go.

293
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,840
It's probably nothing.
Follow me. I said it's nothing.

294
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,800
Come on up.

295
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,720
Dammit! Stop holding on to me!

296
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,680
You're such a burden.

297
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,160
Come on up.

298
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,640
Fine. I'll go first.

299
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,080
Just go already.

300
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,600
Biew.

301
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,600
You'll never get there at this pace.
Hurry.

302
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:08,080
I'm... I'm getting... there.

303
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,160
Just a minute.

304
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:15,080
Nick. Wait... Wait for me.

305
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,880
What's up with him?

306
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,960
Man. What a chicken.
It's just an empty house.

307
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,440
Why are you so scared?

308
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,440
What are you laughing at?

309
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,760
I was just faking it
to lighten up the mood.

310
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,320
James, don't tell me you find this funny.

311
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,560
That really hurt.

312
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,760
Just get up here, James.

313
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,880
Ouch. My balls.

314
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,000
It's throbbing.

315
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,880
They couldn't even wait for me.
I'm only taking a short while.

316
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,920
Hurry up.

317
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,080
Hey! Stop!

318
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,520
Come here. Come here!

319
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,840
Come here.

320
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,600
Them three?

321
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,080
You two!

322
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,360
Can you hear a woman crying?

323
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,360
-Yes!
-Go check it out.

324
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,960
Us two again?

325
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,200
Yes.

326
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,760
Help me!

327
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,320
-Biew, let's go.
-Let's go.

328
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,800
Hurry up.
What are you waiting for?

329
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,720
Open the damn door.

330
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,920
-Why don't you do it yourself, Nick?
-Because I'm telling you two to.

331
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,440
Help me!

332
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,000
Net, I'm afraid.

333
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,480
Don't be afraid.

334
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,280
-I think it sounds familiar.
-I wonder who.

335
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,520
Open it.

336
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,320
Help me.

337
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,440
Quick!

338
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,720
A woman...

339
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:00,440
-about to go into labor.
-Where?

340
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,280
Guys, quick! Come help her!

341
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,520
-Quick!
-Help me!

342
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,520
A baby! A baby!

343
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,040
Hey. Come in.

344
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,840
She's a person, not a ghost.

345
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,320
-Help me!
-Calm down, lady. Just breathe deeply.

346
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,720
Breathe, lady, breathe.

347
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,000
Hand me a cloth!

348
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,800
Hurry up. Bring one!

349
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,240
-This one?
-Any one would do! Quick!

350
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,640
What next?

351
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,840
-I've seen it in a movie?
-What?

352
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,800
-Let her hold on to a cloth.
-Okay. Cloth...

353
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,880
I'm in pain!

354
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,640
Breathe deeply.

355
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,560
-James, hurry!
-Hold on to this!

356
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,800
James. Hang it up.

357
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,920
-Hurry up.
-Help me!

358
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Calm down, lady.

359
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,480
-Tape.
-What? What's wrong?

360
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,360
-I'm in pain!
-Pull on it, lady!

361
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,240
-Hurry up!
-James!

362
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,600
It's too short.

363
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,320
Go get more! Extend it!

364
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,680
Hurry!

365
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,120
It needs to come down lower.

366
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,320
We need hot water.

367
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,800
Go boil some water.

368
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,800
-Net. Brian. Go boil some water.
-Okay.

369
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,960
-Brian, it's dark.
-Here's a lamp.

370
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,320
Found it.

371
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,560
Hurry up with the cloth.

372
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,200
Lady, hold on to this.

373
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,080
One, two, three...

374
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,800
Hey, let's look.

375
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,120
Take a look.

376
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,760
-Take a look.
-So?

377
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,080
No baby!

378
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,840
Boil it now.

379
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,800
-Jam, hand me some wood.
-Sure.

380
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,480
-Go get the water.
-One more time, lady. One...

381
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,200
two, three...

382
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,800
She's pushing.

383
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,400
Jesus! Who farted?

384
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,280
Stinky as a skunk!

385
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,960
Lady, why did you fart?

386
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,160
She didn't fart. You did!

387
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,880
-Whatever. Let's help her first.
-Help her.

388
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,520
Lady, breathe deeply.

389
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,360
-Breathe deeply.
-I'll do it. Let me do it.

390
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,200
I'm good at delivering babies.

391
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,840
-Hand me some wood.
-Here.

392
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,160
It even has a big belly.

393
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,720
Hurry up!

394
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,320
-Let's continue.
-Hurry up, you guys!

395
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,360
Are you okay, Brian?

396
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,640
-Help the lady. Hurry.
-Help the lady.

397
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,000
The water's not hot yet.

398
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,320
James, go check.

399
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,520
Is the water ready?

400
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,440
Hey! Is it ready yet?

401
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,680
The lady's about to die, dammit.

402
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,640
-Let me do it.
-Hurry up!

403
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,760
Hey, let me do it.

404
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,720
-Give it here.
-Just decide who's doing what already!

405
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,280
One, two, three...

406
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,680
James! James!

407
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,520
Just go.

408
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,160
Hey! Is it ready?

409
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,120
How is she?

410
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,680
The water's almost ready.
Is the baby out yet?

411
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,720
-Not yet.
-Hey, lady...

412
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:30,960
Lady.

413
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:34,200
-Is the water ready?
-You go watch it boil.

414
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,000
Lady?

415
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,600
-Lady? Lady?
-How's it going?

416
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,800
-The water's ready.
-James, check her breath.

417
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,720
She's not breathing.

418
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,480
-She's dead!
-She's dead.

419
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,840
Let's get out of here! Let's run!

420
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,280
Let's run!

421
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,760
She's dead!

422
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,640
James, wait.

423
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,480
Someone's coming.

424
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,280
Find somewhere to hide. Come on.

425
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,520
-Mom! Where is it?
-We're almost there.

426
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,480
There it is. There.

427
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,240
Let's walk faster then.

428
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,280
-Walk faster.
-Yeah.

429
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,720
Who are we hiding from?

430
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,200
From these two who are going upstairs.

431
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,400
-Those two ladies?
-Yes. Shut up before they hear you!

432
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,240
Nak, I'm here. I'm here now, Nak.

433
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:48,600
Mom, go boil some water.

434
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,800
There's some here.
Someone broiled some water already.

435
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,680
I want boiled water, not broiled water.

436
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,880
-Well, it's right here.
-Yeah, yeah.

437
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,480
Nak. Hold on to this cloth.

438
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,880
Cloth...

439
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,800
When I tell you to push, you push.

440
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,080
What should we do next?

441
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,200
We go home.

442
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:19,160
-James, you chicken.
-Chicken?

443
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,400
Okay. Push.

444
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,040
Push...

445
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,840
Nak.

446
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,400
-Auntie.
-What?

447
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,720
-Nak is dead.
-What?

448
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,640
Nak is dead?

449
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,360
James!

450
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,160
Get in!

451
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,000
-Hurry up!
-Let's go.

452
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,160
-Hurry up!
-Go forward!

453
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,840
Biew, hurry up!

454
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:00,280
Biew! Biew!

455
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,200
-Hurry up!
-Quick!

456
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,120
Why are we back here again?

457
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,040
It won't go...

458
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,640
Damn, I can't take this anymore.

459
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,640
-Nick!
-Get out of the way.

460
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,920
Get out of the way.

461
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,200
Nick.

462
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,200
Nick. Take it easy.

463
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:46,240
Mae Nak!
Why don't you throw something at me?

464
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,280
I've paddled three rounds now!

465
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,640
If you're so powerful
then throw something!

466
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,920
That's all you got?

467
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,960
Got any more?

468
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,320
If yes, then show your powers!

469
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,600
Ghost! Ghost!

470
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:55,600
Hey! Ghost! Nick! Hey!

471
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,040
Brian! James! Wake up! Nick!

472
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,040
Nick!

473
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,160
Biew! Wake up!

474
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,880
What are you yelling about?

475
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,320
I'm trying to sleep.

476
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,640
Gawao, come here.

477
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:29,960
-Come over here.
-I cannot go...

478
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,680
Mae Nak...

479
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,840
Why are you down there? Come up here.

480
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,760
-I'm not going up there!
-James. Come up.

481
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,800
Quick.

482
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,240
-I'm not going.
-Quick.

483
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,040
Lady.

484
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,600
Are you Mae Nak?

485
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:00,480
You've never believed
that I was real, did you?

486
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,400
Yes, we did.

487
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:03,760
But this guy...

488
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,040
didn't.

489
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,280
Assholes, putting all the blame on me.

490
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,240
Mae Nak.

491
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,280
Aren't you dead?

492
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:14,600
Last night we helped you give birth.
I've seen it with my own eyes

493
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,080
that you died.

494
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,440
If I were dead...

495
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,240
I wouldn't be sitting in front of you.

496
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,440
Granny Erb saved me in time.

497
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,240
Then why did you bring me here?

498
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,000
I want you to do me a favor.

499
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,160
I want you to go and find my husband.

500
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:36,200
He has been a soldier for many months now.
I'm worried about him...

501
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,280
-This is familiar.
-Find my husband

502
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:42,120
and tell him that I have given birth.
His name is Dum.

503
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,440
It's Dang!

504
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,480
As in "red."

505
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,160
That is the name.

506
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,000
Why don't you go?

507
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,960
I am a woman, not a man,
and my husband has gone to war,

508
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,640
-I cannot go look for him.
-This is familiar.

509
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,600
Again?

510
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,200
Are you willing to help me?

511
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,280
What if I'm not?

512
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,200
Do you want to go home

513
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,000
or stay here with me?

514
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,160
We'll help...

515
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,760
Wait.

516
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,800
Do you know where to go?

517
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,760
That's right.

518
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,240
Follow this path in here.

519
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,040
Biew.

520
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,440
James. Go get it.

521
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,120
Can you use someone else?

522
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,360
Net. Go get it.

523
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,760
-No.
-Go get it.

524
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,600
Brian! Go get it.

525
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,880
-No.
-Now!

526
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,520
Go on. Quickly.

527
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,960
How would I know
which one is your husband?

528
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:32,040
My husband has a beard and a mustache.
His name is Mak.

529
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:35,520
-This is familiar too.
-You're familiar with everything.

530
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,840
Has a beard and a mustache.
His name is Mak.

531
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,960
Biew. James. Remember this.

532
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:49,560
My husband has a beard and a mustache.
His name is Mak.

533
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,400
-Let's go.
-Wait.

534
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,480
You cannot go looking like this.

535
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,800
And how are we suppose to look like?

536
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,160
Leave it up to me.

537
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:10,840
We've been walking for a while now
and still no battle field in sight.

538
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:14,080
Why're you complaining, James?
Maybe they've stopped fighting.

539
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,440
Brian, come walk over here.

540
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,200
-No.
-Why not?

541
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,840
I hate you.

542
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,680
Nick, my buddy,
when are we going to get there?

543
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,680
I think you're lost.

544
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:36,360
We've been walking for three periods
and we're still not there.

545
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,320
Stop whining so much.

546
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,640
And what is this "period," Biew?

547
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,240
Nick, James...

548
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,760
What's that?

549
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,320
Maybe it's a shooting star, Nick.

550
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,560
James, come here.

551
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,720
Get off me, Net.

552
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:46,960
I've never seen a bomb
this up close in my entire life.

553
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,560
It nearly landed on my head.

554
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,160
-But I've seen this before.
-Where?

555
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,760
-Ratchaprasong bombing.
-What the hell are you talking about?

556
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,680
There are dead bodies in here.

557
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:09,360
I know how we can find Mak.

558
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,280
Hey! Let's go!

559
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,680
Let's go find Mak!

560
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,600
We should hide here for now.

561
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,320
Wait until they've all killed each other,
then we'll go and find Mak.

562
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,080
What the hell did you make me wear?

563
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,360
Good idea, Nick, my buddy.

564
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,880
Fight!

565
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,240
Let's go!

566
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,000
Shit!

567
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,360
You two, go check over there.

568
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,040
I'll keep watch here.

569
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,400
-Quick!
-Why aren't you coming?

570
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,480
I said I'll keep watch here.

571
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,400
Go!

572
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:18,960
Fine.

573
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:20,880
Hurry.

574
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:25,880
Bastard!

575
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,040
Son of a bitch!

576
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,600
Biew, go look.

577
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,760
Someone with a beard and a mustache.

578
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,400
-Does he have any?
-Nope. Neither does he.

579
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,080
What a mess.

580
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,560
Biew, come here.

581
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,600
Not this one.

582
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:03,600
-He's dead. Is he dead?
-Not yet.

583
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,760
-You chink!
-Easy!

584
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:19,560
Easy! Easy! Easy!

585
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,360
I'm Thai! I'm Thai!

586
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,640
Nick. Biew.

587
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,480
-What is it?
-This guy has a beard and a mustache.

588
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,040
-Let's take a look.
-Let's go.

589
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:33,600
Where?

590
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:38,520
Yeah, let's go. Drag him along. Quick.

591
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,600
Don't... Aren't you afraid of guns?

592
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,480
-Let's push it.
-Brian, help me.

593
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,680
No. Push, Nick, push.

594
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,440
-What's wrong with you, Brian?
-What's wrong with you?

595
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,040
Here, I'll help.

596
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,240
-Shit.
-Hurry up.

597
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:08,880
Back off! Biew! Biew!

598
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,280
Come on, guys. Quick.

599
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,960
-Hurry.
-Be careful.

600
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,240
Back off. Back off!

601
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:21,360
-Just leave them. Come on.
-Biew, let's go.

602
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,120
-I'm out of here.
-James.

603
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,600
Hey! We're on the same side!

604
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,240
Don't shoot! We're on the same side! Biew!

605
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,920
Go away! Hurry up! Quick!

606
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:42,640
Hurry.

607
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,960
Put your back into it.

608
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,600
One, two, three, go!

609
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,040
Careful!

610
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,600
-James, push.
-Push.

611
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:08,360
-A novice ghost.
-What kind of ghost dresses like a monk?

612
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,920
-Is there a problem?
-Novice.

613
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,440
Help us, please. We have an injured man.

614
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,000
Follow me.

615
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:23,760
-We have a place to sleep now, Biew.
-Yeah. Let's go.

616
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,200
-Let's go.
-Quick.

617
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,960
-Did we forget something?
-What?

618
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,400
Shit! Go get him!

619
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,400
James, help me first. Right here.

620
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,040
One, two, three.

621
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,200
Let's go.

622
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,240
-Go on.
-Net. Brian. Push.

623
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,520
We're pushing.

624
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,280
Biew. James.
Which one do you think is Mak?

625
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,520
Probably not the first one.

626
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,320
-What about the second one?
-I don't think so.

627
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:55,000
I think the third one might be him.

628
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,440
Huge pecs.

629
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,720
I think it's this one.

630
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,920
James. There's no way. Take a good look.

631
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,560
Skinny as a crack addict.

632
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,040
No way it's him.

633
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,760
-No?
-I think it's this one.

634
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,960
Check out that six-pack.

635
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,320
Check out that face.

636
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,120
This is clearly Chan Nuat Keow.

637
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,560
Which one's Mak?

638
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,320
They've all got facial hair.

639
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,000
Novice.

640
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,520
Bring Mak inside.

641
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,760
He is the most fatally injured.

642
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,960
Yes, Luang Por.

643
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:45,400
Novice, which one is Mak?

644
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,440
Him.

645
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,200
-Mak.
-Mak.

646
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:52,880
-Mak.
-Mak.

647
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:53,960
-Mak.
-Mak.

648
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,040
-Mak.
-Mak.

649
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,040
He's awake.

650
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,360
Who are you?

651
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:03,360
Your wife, Mae Nak, asked us

652
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,640
to find you.

653
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:06,960
My wife, Nak...

654
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:10,320
Is she...

655
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:16,560
Mak... Mak is dead.

656
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,240
-Mak.
-Mak!

657
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:22,840
Mae Nak will hurt you, Nick.

658
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,560
I am not dead.

659
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,800
What a relief.
You made me really scared there.

660
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:33,400
Your hair color is so beautiful.

661
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,960
Oh, I colored my hair...

662
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:39,640
when I prayed to you.

663
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:44,520
I want to thank you...

664
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:49,240
for helping me win the scholarship
to study in England.

665
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:53,920
Actually, I did not help any of you.

666
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:58,320
Each and every day, many people come
to make a wish from me.

667
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,680
How can I help everyone?

668
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:03,080
I did not do anything.

669
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:06,080
You have your own perseverance.

670
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:14,840
Mae Nak, so you and Mak love each other
enough to die for one another?

671
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,240
<i>Mak loves me so much...</i>

672
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,320
You smell so sweet.

673
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:25,320
<i>From dawn until dusk...</i>

674
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,800
You smell so sweet.

675
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:30,440
<i>He would not let me doing anything else.</i>

676
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:32,600
You smell so sweet.

677
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,520
Let us just not eat at all.

678
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:38,360
<i>When I was pregnant,</i>
<i>Mak had to join the army.</i>

679
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,200
You smell so sweet.

680
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,120
Again?

681
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:47,760
So I had to be all alone.

682
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:56,000
-What?
-Can you remember what James said?

683
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:59,320
If you want to know
if she's a ghost or not...

684
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,960
you must stand on your hands.

685
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:03,680
Look in between your legs.

686
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,480
This way, you'll see.

687
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:07,160
James would never lie.

688
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:10,080
-Let's do it.
-One...

689
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,680
two, three.

690
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:16,000
Jam.

691
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:17,680
I see nothing.

692
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,240
Can't you see her giving Gawao a haircut?

693
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:23,360
I'll do it. You're useless.

694
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:25,040
One more time.

695
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:30,560
Can you see it, Tape?

696
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:31,880
Nope.

697
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:36,040
-If this one fails, I'll chew James out.
-Okay.

698
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:39,040
I'll try one more time. Hold my legs.

699
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:42,120
One, two, three...

700
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:46,640
Tape...

701
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:48,840
What do you see?

702
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,040
Where did Mae Nak go?

703
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,840
Where did she go?

704
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:58,240
How about that? You see?
James never lies.

705
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:00,880
Told you so. James never lies.

706
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:43,240
Hey, you.

707
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:45,160
Hey, you.

708
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:59,760
Was it you who Nak sent to find me?

709
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:03,160
That's right, Mak.

710
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:06,400
Biew.

711
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:13,320
Watch your leg.

712
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:16,480
Nick's back.

713
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,080
Nick. James.

714
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:23,160
-James.
-How are you guys?

715
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:27,120
Nearly didn't make it.
Good thing that I'm such a boss.

716
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:29,680
And... that's...

717
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
-Mak, right?
-Of course.

718
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:39,160
Mae Nak. They've brought Mak back.

719
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:43,960
-Mae Nak's in her room?
-Yes.

720
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:57,160
Mak.

721
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,120
Nak.

722
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:02,360
Mak.

723
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:03,760
Nak.

724
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:04,720
Mak.

725
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:05,800
Nak.

726
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:07,000
Mak.

727
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:08,680
-Nak.
-Mak.

728
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:10,880
-Nak.
-Mak.

729
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:12,360
Enough already.

730
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:30,040
Nak, I missed you so much.
How are you?

731
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:38,040
You smell so sweet.

732
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,200
I love you so much.

733
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,040
I want you.

734
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:48,600
-Right now?
-Correct.

735
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:06,920
Damn you, Biew!

736
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:09,600
-Shit.
-James.

737
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:11,120
What?

738
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:15,080
You told me to stand on my hands.
I tried it and saw nothing.

739
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
-Did you do it wrong?
-Yeah.

740
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:22,000
I did it right. I really saw nothing.

741
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,200
Live show...

742
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:46,280
Bodacious.

743
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,600
-Bodacious.
-What does that mean?

744
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:52,080
Awesome.

745
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:04,720
James! Did you see what I saw?

746
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,920
Mak is making love to a...

747
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:12,080
ghost!

748
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:18,080
-I saw it vividly.
-Now is our chance.

749
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:22,600
While Mak and Mae Nak are getting it on,
we can escape.

750
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:26,200
-Let's go.
-Wait.

751
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:27,880
How are you going, Nick?

752
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,000
I haven't seen the boat for many days.

753
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:32,440
That's right. I haven't seen it.

754
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:34,760
-Man, let's just go check.
-Yeah, let's go.

755
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:42,760
There really is no boat.

756
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:44,560
What now?

757
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,920
Let's go search for one. Come on.

758
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:49,960
-Okay.
-Make way.

759
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:51,600
Make way. Move. Move.

760
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:57,720
Which way next?

761
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:00,880
Go grab a lamp and follow me.

762
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:03,640
James, go get the lamp.

763
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,160
Hey, you guys, go get it.

764
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:10,200
-Nick, wait for me.
-Go get it.

765
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:12,800
Jam, take one.

766
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:15,280
Guys, wait for me.

767
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:18,840
Hurry up.

768
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,440
Hurry up, back there.

769
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,600
I think it's Phra Kanong village.

770
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:35,480
But where's everyone?

771
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:50,960
-James.
-What?

772
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:52,600
Someone's coming.

773
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:56,880
Are they ghosts?

774
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:01,680
Ghost, my ass! Look, they're alive.

775
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:05,840
Auntie... where are you going?

776
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,880
I cannot stay any longer.
Nak haunts me every night.

777
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:09,920
Goodbye.

778
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Ghost of Mae Nak!

779
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:14,440
Ghost of Mae Nak.

780
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:16,960
I say we get going.
Mae Nak might follow us.

781
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,240
How could she follow us?

782
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:20,760
We just saw Mae Nak and Mak...

783
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:28,280
getting it on...
They're probably still at it.

784
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:32,960
Let's go. You guys keep your eyes peeled.

785
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:34,440
There might be a boat.

786
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:35,960
Let me go, Net.

787
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:42,120
-Hurry up.
-Why are you crying, Biew?

788
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:46,640
-Hey! Nick.
-What?

789
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:49,000
There's a boat under that house.

790
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,040
-Hurry up then.
-Okay.

791
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:58,760
James, you paddle.

792
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:01,120
You keep paddling.
No slacking off.

793
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:03,720
-Quickly.
-Hurry up,

794
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:05,240
or Mae Nak will catch up.

795
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:07,360
Why are you so scared?

796
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,360
Mae Nak isn't mean at all.

797
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:10,600
Yeah.

798
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:13,320
-That's right, Nick.
-Do you want to see her get mean?

799
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:18,760
Go tell Mak that she's dead.
Then you'll get to see.

800
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:20,560
See what?

801
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:23,040
See that Mae Nak is mean.

802
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:26,960
-Where are you going?
-We're going home.

803
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:37,680
Mae Nak!

804
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:41,960
-Let's go.
-She's staring at us.

805
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:43,800
Hurry up!

806
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:50,400
-Paddle faster!
-Go, go, go...

807
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:52,080
I'm paddling fast!

808
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:12,440
Darn it, Mom.

809
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:16,840
There are so many paths to home,
but you always take me this way.

810
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:34,080
Oh, Granny Prig.

811
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:35,680
Hello.

812
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:38,680
Mak. Have you been back long?

813
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:40,200
I just got back today.

814
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:43,120
-Do you know--
-Granny!

815
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,160
Nak, your wife, is dead.

816
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:49,120
Granny...

817
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:52,880
How dare you say that?

818
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:56,840
If you weren't such an old crone,
I'd knock you out right here.

819
00:54:58,320 --> 00:54:59,160
Mom.

820
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:03,080
You saw that Nak is dead.
You saw it with your own eyes.

821
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:08,960
It's true, Mak. I saw it with my own eyes
that Nak...

822
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:13,640
-is already dead.
-You two talk trash about my wife.

823
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:14,920
I will knock you out!

824
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:19,640
You do not believe us?

825
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,640
-Then I am going.
-Granny. Granny...

826
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:29,320
-Granny!
-What?

827
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,760
It's Nak!

828
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:35,280
-Mom!
-Granny...

829
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:38,520
Gra... Granny...

830
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:47,600
Damn those two running their mouths...

831
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,720
My wife is still in the house.

832
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:53,520
How dare they lie that she is dead?

833
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,360
Nak!

834
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:23,840
What is it, Prig?

835
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:35,600
Prig, you've left me.

836
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:39,840
Nak, you shouldn't have killed Prig.

837
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:52,680
-Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!
-Hurry!

838
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:58,480
-Hurry up! Let's go, James.
-Let's go!

839
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:11,440
Ghost!

840
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:15,520
How did Mae Nak's corpse bloat so fast?

841
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:20,960
I'm not a ghost. I'm human.

842
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:24,240
If you don't believe me, touch my flesh.

843
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:26,320
You go.

844
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:30,760
You go!

845
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:32,960
Stop arguing, you guys.

846
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:34,320
Go!

847
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:46,320
So is she human or a ghost?

848
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:49,760
She's human.

849
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:53,320
Hey! What's happening?

850
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,360
What's happening? Where's the ghost?

851
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:58,960
-Let me!
-Wait!

852
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:02,920
What are you waiting for? Run.

853
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:12,320
M... Mae N... Nak...

854
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:17,360
Do you know what not to say?

855
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:20,160
Yes.

856
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:23,280
We shouldn't tell you
that Mak is dead, right?

857
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:29,800
We shouldn't tell you
that Mak is dead, right?

858
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:34,240
You morons. Move aside.

859
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:38,560
We shouldn't tell Mak
that you're dead, right?

860
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:41,440
If you know then hurry back to the house.

861
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:42,520
Okay.

862
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:46,360
Come on, you morons.

863
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:47,960
Follow me, quick.

864
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,400
-Yeah, let's go.
-Okay.

865
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:52,320
Okay, let's go.

866
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:03,040
They're morons. I'm smart.

867
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:39,240
Biew! Biew!

868
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:43,680
-Brian!
-Time for breakfast. What?

869
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:45,680
Look!

870
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:49,560
Dang Phra Khanong!

871
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:54,360
Nick, are you rocking the cradle?

872
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:57,840
I'm not rocking it!
It's doing that on its own!

873
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:05,480
Biew. James. Go take a look
if Dang Phra Khanong is in the cradle.

874
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:07,000
-Go!
-Hurry up.

875
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:09,080
-Go on. Go look.
-Go.

876
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:11,240
-Go on.
-Fine.

877
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:14,240
Hurry up.

878
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:17,600
Me again.

879
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:23,480
Nick!

880
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:25,560
Why don't you come with us?

881
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:28,320
Yeah. Nick, you go.

882
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:29,920
I'll stay here.

883
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:32,760
-Fine. Let's go.
-Let's all go.

884
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,160
-It stopped.
-Go on.

885
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:55,760
Let's go.

886
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:24,960
What's going on?

887
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:26,760
Oh...

888
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:29,400
Dang, your baby...

889
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:33,160
-rocked the cradle on its own.
-The cradle rocked on its own.

890
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:36,160
My baby is adorable.

891
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,400
Isn't that right, Dang?

892
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:41,560
How could he do that?

893
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:49,000
Oh, where did you go to last night?
I looked everywhere for you.

894
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:51,320
-Oh...
-We went for a run...

895
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:52,640
We went for a run...

896
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:53,680
Where?

897
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,240
Where did we go?

898
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:59,720
-Where did we go?
-That place.

899
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:02,160
Yeah! That place!

900
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:03,640
-That place!
-Yeah, that place.

901
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,240
Around here!

902
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:08,200
When will you let us go home?
I already found Mak for you.

903
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:10,720
Why are you in a rush to leave?

904
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:14,280
I know that you don't want to leave yet.
Isn't that true?

905
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:19,080
Right. We don't want to go home.

906
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:22,000
Good. Stay and have dinner with me first.

907
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:24,760
This evening, I'll make you chili paste.

908
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:25,880
Chili paste?

909
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:28,880
My wife's chili paste is the best
in Phra Kanong.

910
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:30,880
Last time I had some, I...

911
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:34,120
For seven days and seven nights.

912
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:40,840
-You smell so sweet.
-Enough already.

913
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:42,320
I am very tired.

914
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:44,600
Last night must've been rough.

915
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:49,520
But last night,
Prig lied to me that my wife is dead.

916
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:51,640
Do you believe her?

917
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:52,880
Dead. Dead.

918
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:54,280
-Dead.
-Dead?

919
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:59,280
Not dead. Who said dead? Not dead.

920
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:00,200
Not dead.

921
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:03,640
If anyone lies about my wife...

922
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:05,480
I will kill them.

923
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:12,080
I am going to go gather some vegetables
and fish for you all.

924
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:13,560
Who will come with me?

925
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:15,400
-Me...
-Me...

926
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:16,320
Me!

927
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:17,680
I shall hurry back.

928
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:20,880
Hurry up and follow me.

929
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:23,480
-Come on. Quick.
-Let me go first!

930
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:26,480
Tape.

931
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:27,400
Wait.

932
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:32,800
You do not need to go.

933
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:35,400
Stay and play with my son,
Dang Phra Khanong.

934
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:41,800
What now?

935
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:44,000
Let's go take a look.

936
01:03:59,000 --> 01:03:59,960
Biew.

937
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:01,720
Tell him.

938
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:04,560
No way. I'm afraid.

939
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:07,360
-James.
-Huh?

940
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:08,880
Tell Mak.

941
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:13,920
Mak.

942
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:16,680
-What is it?
-Mae Nak...

943
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:23,680
is home!

944
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:27,920
-She's home.
-Why are you telling me this?

945
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:31,400
I just wanted to let you know she's home.

946
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:35,000
Why are you guys afraid? I'll show you.

947
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:37,200
I'll tell him.

948
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:38,640
Okay. Do it.

949
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:42,240
-Good. Good.
-Mak.

950
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:46,480
-What's going on with you guys?
-See...

951
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:48,440
Well...

952
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:51,240
the fish is there!

953
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:54,400
Gawao, you nincompoop!

954
01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:57,400
That hurt.

955
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:01,480
I though you had the guts.

956
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:04,360
Mak!

957
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:06,720
Who's he?

958
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:08,120
Kham!

959
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:14,600
-What is it?
-Do you know

960
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:16,160
that Granny Prig is dead?

961
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:18,040
Why are you telling me this?

962
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:20,400
Because your wife, Nak, killed Prig.

963
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:24,760
-How dare you say that?
-Mom, my sister,

964
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:28,440
saw it with her own eyes
that Nak killed Prig!

965
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:31,320
You watch your mouth, Kham!

966
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:32,760
Mak! Don't!

967
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:36,880
Biew... the knife dropped.

968
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:40,760
No! Don't. Wait! Take it easy!

969
01:05:48,840 --> 01:05:49,680
Kham!

970
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:54,040
If you keep on accusing my wife,
I will knock you right out!

971
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:56,120
Well, your wife is really dead!

972
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:04,600
Mak! Fight again! Go for it!

973
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:06,920
Elbow him! Go for it!

974
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:10,200
Where are you running to, Kham?

975
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:16,400
Your wife is really dead.

976
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:22,440
Mak!

977
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:25,080
-Mak... are you okay?
-James, go check.

978
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:26,040
Are you okay?

979
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:28,240
I'll tell you the truth...

980
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:30,400
your wife is already dead.

981
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:35,040
It's true.

982
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:42,120
I have nothing to do with this.

983
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:47,440
Mae Nak, she's dead.

984
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:49,560
I mean...

985
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:50,960
Mae Nak is dead.

986
01:06:56,680 --> 01:07:00,360
Mak, I'll prove it to you tonight
that Nak is a ghost.

987
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:02,360
-Let's go.
-Yeah, I know.

988
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:07,400
-Hey, bring the vegetables and fish.
-Sure.

989
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:12,360
-He's so heavy.
-Hurry up.

990
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,520
Mak has dropped...

991
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:30,080
Here, it's done.

992
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:03,160
Mak, who did you hair? It looks good.

993
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:08,760
My buddies Nick, James,
Biew, and Gawao did it.

994
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:10,640
How do I look?

995
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:15,360
Do not ask me.
No man is ever as handsome as my husband.

996
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,320
See? See?

997
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:22,760
Have you all showered and changed?

998
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:25,800
Of course, my lovely wife.

999
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:34,240
You smell so sweet.

1000
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:37,720
Better not. I am very tired today.

1001
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:41,600
I have to go downstairs to grill the fish.

1002
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:44,920
Good.

1003
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:49,200
Once the fish is cooked,
my chili paste should be ready.

1004
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:51,680
Go grill the fish. Go on.

1005
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:02,040
Nick, Gawao, my buddies...

1006
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:04,120
It's too late for you.

1007
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:08,440
You two stay and help me
make the chili paste up here.

1008
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:11,800
Make the chili paste?

1009
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:13,960
Okay. Okay...

1010
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:17,880
Hurry up. Come here.

1011
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:22,000
Come over here.

1012
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:29,440
Mak, I've seen the movie, <i>Nang Nak.</i>

1013
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:32,080
-What movie?
-Just trust me.

1014
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:35,760
When ever Mae Nak makes chili paste,
she would drop a lime,

1015
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:37,880
then she would reach for it,

1016
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:42,240
and you, Mak, would know
that Mae Nak is a ghost.

1017
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:46,360
-But it has to be a lime and nothing else.
-Yeah, this is familiar.

1018
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:48,920
I've seen the movie too.
He's right, Mak.

1019
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:51,320
-Really?
-Of course.

1020
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:57,600
There are eight limes.

1021
01:09:58,280 --> 01:09:59,440
What should we do?

1022
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:04,120
-Hand me a--
-Lime!

1023
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:05,960
-Lime.
-Eggplant.

1024
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:08,680
-Not lime.
-Eggplant.

1025
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:30,240
I see nothing.

1026
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:31,480
Only lime dropping.

1027
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:32,880
Be patient!

1028
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:35,640
How will I know that my wife... is dead?

1029
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:37,080
The lime will come.

1030
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:38,560
-Hand me a--
-Lime, right?

1031
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:40,080
Lime...

1032
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:43,320
There it is!

1033
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:46,080
What is it?

1034
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:50,840
Here it is.

1035
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:53,120
It's an eggplant.

1036
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:56,040
The lime is here.

1037
01:10:58,160 --> 01:10:59,400
Then what was that?

1038
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:01,440
Eggplant.

1039
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:03,840
It wasn't a lime.

1040
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:08,560
Lime! Lime! Lime!

1041
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:10,080
Lime! Lime!

1042
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:13,360
-The lime has dropped.
-There's the lime.

1043
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:16,760
Mak! Mak!

1044
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:18,800
Mak! Mak! Mak!

1045
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:22,360
-Oh...
-All out of lime!

1046
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:24,160
-No more lime!
-Nothing here!

1047
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:25,120
Only eggplants.

1048
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,320
Then go fetch it.

1049
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:29,960
Why don't you fetch it yourself?

1050
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:34,440
Mak! Mak!

1051
01:11:34,520 --> 01:11:35,480
Mak!

1052
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:13,920
Nick! Nick--

1053
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:21,840
Mak, look!

1054
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:25,680
And it's gone...

1055
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:35,960
Lime.

1056
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:37,760
We don't want it anymore.

1057
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:39,560
You can have it.

1058
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:44,160
You're lying about my wife.

1059
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:48,280
My wife is so beautiful.
She is not like what you said.

1060
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:50,720
-It's not like that!
-I'm not talking to you anymore.

1061
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:51,880
Excuse us.

1062
01:12:55,960 --> 01:12:58,200
Mak! Mak! Mak!

1063
01:12:58,280 --> 01:13:00,520
-How can it be this way?
-I don't know?

1064
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:01,680
What do we do next?

1065
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:19,520
<i>What is it, Luang Por?</i>

1066
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:21,760
Why have you come to see me?

1067
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:24,320
Mak...

1068
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:30,560
-Who do you live with in this house?
-My son and my wife.

1069
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:34,440
And where is your wife?

1070
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:37,640
<i>She's inside.</i>

1071
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:43,760
<i>Mak, if you wish to know the truth...</i>

1072
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:49,480
<i>make a wish and think of the Buddha</i>

1073
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:52,640
<i>then look in between your legs...</i>

1074
01:13:53,480 --> 01:13:55,040
<i>and you will see the truth.</i>

1075
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:03,320
Nak...

1076
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:06,120
What is Mak doing?

1077
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:26,840
Mak! Mak!

1078
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:28,640
Mak! Mak!

1079
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:29,800
Mak! Mak!

1080
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:31,560
-Hurry!
-Mak! Hurry up!

1081
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:32,920
-Hurry up!
-Pull him out!

1082
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:44,240
Why did you tell my husband?

1083
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:46,320
We didn't tell him.

1084
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:48,240
He found out himself.

1085
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:51,480
What about under the house?

1086
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:54,080
Under the house?

1087
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:57,400
I don't know anything about that.
Right, James?

1088
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:00,000
-Right?
-Right... Yes, m'am.

1089
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:03,360
Do you not wish to go home?

1090
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:06,040
-Of course we do.
-We do.

1091
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:12,480
How did you get here?

1092
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:28,480
Why did you tell my husband the news?

1093
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:31,320
Mae Nak, please calm down.

1094
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:34,440
Mak already knows the truth...

1095
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:38,720
Smile, Mae Nak, smile.

1096
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:40,280
Smile...

1097
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:42,600
How about this?

1098
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:45,800
The three of us will cheer you up.

1099
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:49,440
-Isn't that right, Biew, my buddy?
-Yeah.

1100
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:51,560
-Right, Nick, my buddy?
-Ready?

1101
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:54,040
-Ready!
-Ready, James, my buddy?

1102
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:55,360
Born ready, buddy.

1103
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:57,720
Ready?

1104
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:06,440
Smile. Smile. Smile...

1105
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:08,160
If you're ready, then lead.

1106
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:10,440
Lead.

1107
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:12,440
Ready?

1108
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:16,880
-Oh, I get it. Go get Mak.
-Three, four...

1109
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:33,440
You didn't like that?

1110
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:36,720
No reaction.

1111
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:38,040
Biew!

1112
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:41,240
Perform a single, buddy.

1113
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:48,800
Ready, buddies?

1114
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:52,280
-Ready.
-Three, four...

1115
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:54,320
Bounce, bounce to the front.

1116
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:56,120
Bounce, bounce to the front.

1117
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:58,080
Bounce, bounce to the front.

1118
01:16:58,240 --> 01:16:59,920
Bounce, bounce to the front.

1119
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,680
Bounce, bounce to the front.

1120
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:03,280
Bounce, bounce to the front.

1121
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:05,440
Close to you my heart flutters.

1122
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:07,200
Bounce, bounce to the front.

1123
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:09,120
Bounce, bounce to the front.

1124
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:10,920
Bounce, bounce to the front.

1125
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:16,080
Bounce, bounce...

1126
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:18,560
Nick. James. Where are you?

1127
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:22,680
Brian. Grab the torch.

1128
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:24,360
-Torch?
-There.

1129
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:35,320
Got it.

1130
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:38,480
Bounce, bounce to the front.

1131
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:40,400
Bounce, bounce to the front.

1132
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:43,080
Bounce, bounce to the front.

1133
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:45,480
Bounce, bounce to the front.

1134
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:47,440
Bounce, bounce to the front.

1135
01:17:51,160 --> 01:17:52,040
I'm stuck.

1136
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:54,080
My butt is stuck.

1137
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:56,840
It's lit.

1138
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:01,240
So where are we going?

1139
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:02,480
Which way should we go?

1140
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:04,960
Wat Mahabut.

1141
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:09,480
Take me to Wat Mahabut.

1142
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:10,760
Which way is that?

1143
01:18:16,160 --> 01:18:17,640
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

1144
01:18:17,720 --> 01:18:19,440
Let's go. Follow me.

1145
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:22,840
Keep calm...

1146
01:18:34,760 --> 01:18:35,720
Hurry up.

1147
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:40,520
-Which way?
-Which way is Wat Mahabut?

1148
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:42,440
-Turn right!
-Turn left!

1149
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:45,160
-What are you doing?
-Which way?

1150
01:18:45,240 --> 01:18:47,240
-I said turn left!
-Turn right!

1151
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:51,920
-So which way exactly?
-Just go left, Brian.

1152
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,280
-Come on. Follow me, quick.
-Hurry up.

1153
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:57,960
-Mak!
-Mak, are you all right?

1154
01:18:58,040 --> 01:19:01,840
-You morons. Be careful. Follow me, quick.
-Hurry up.

1155
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:04,000
Careful.

1156
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:13,560
-Nick, wait for me.
-Hurry up then.

1157
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:16,520
Hurry up, Biew.

1158
01:19:20,440 --> 01:19:22,080
-Nick! James!
-What? Hurry up.

1159
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:23,280
Wait for me!

1160
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:29,040
Hey, buddies! You abandoned me! Help me!

1161
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:30,960
What should we do, Nick?

1162
01:19:31,680 --> 01:19:33,000
Help me!

1163
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:36,360
-Always causing trouble.
-Hurry up.

1164
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:38,320
Why didn't you run?

1165
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:42,400
-What do we do, Nick?
-Hold the basket. I'll pull.

1166
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:44,640
-Hurry up!
-Dammit, Biew.

1167
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:48,840
One, two, three!

1168
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:01,760
Son of a bitch...

1169
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:03,760
Get inside the chapel!

1170
01:20:07,160 --> 01:20:08,600
Biew, wait for me!

1171
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:09,760
Wait for me!

1172
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:18,320
Hurry up.

1173
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:20,840
I've never seen this place before.

1174
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:25,320
Hey! There's Wat Mahabut. Let's go, quick.

1175
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:26,840
Yeah. Let's go.

1176
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:38,520
There it is.

1177
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:51,000
Mak. Mak.

1178
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:52,840
Mak. Mak. Mak.

1179
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:54,440
Mak. Wake up, Mak.

1180
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:56,360
Mak. Mak. Mak.

1181
01:20:56,920 --> 01:20:57,760
Mak.

1182
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:05,520
Where have you brought me?

1183
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:07,240
It's Wat Mahabut, Mak.

1184
01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:09,000
Why are there no monks?

1185
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:11,080
That way.

1186
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:16,040
Luang Por!

1187
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:22,600
Mak.

1188
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:26,840
What happened?

1189
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:28,840
Nak is dead.

1190
01:21:31,240 --> 01:21:32,240
Nak is dead.

1191
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:34,720
Nak is dead.

1192
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:36,960
Gentlemen!

1193
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:38,960
You're all monks.

1194
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:40,640
Why are you so afraid?

1195
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:43,280
You're going to pull my robe off.

1196
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:48,480
What are you...

1197
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:50,760
What...

1198
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:54,320
What did you say?
I don't... understand.

1199
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:57,400
What are you going to do?

1200
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:58,880
If I knew,

1201
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:01,480
why would I come to you?

1202
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:03,120
Do not raise your voice.

1203
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:05,000
Nak is your wife.

1204
01:22:06,240 --> 01:22:07,400
Why do you fear her?

1205
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:10,600
I did not fear her when she was alive.

1206
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:14,040
But now that she is dead,
I am scared as a mouse.

1207
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:22,040
Keep your composure.

1208
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:27,000
Mak, you have put us in trouble again.

1209
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:28,720
But it's okay...

1210
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:31,400
You are still a pupil of mine.

1211
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:32,880
I will help you.

1212
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:36,280
Monks. Novices. In position.

1213
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:39,520
In position!

1214
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:42,720
Get ready. Go get the holy thread.

1215
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:53,960
-Nick?
-What?

1216
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:56,600
Why did you bring me into this chapel?

1217
01:22:56,920 --> 01:22:59,520
This is where Mae Nak wouldn't dare enter.

1218
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:02,480
Are you sure, Nick?

1219
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:03,600
Yes.

1220
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:05,800
Are you sure, Nick?

1221
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:07,680
Of course, I'm sure.

1222
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:14,040
Biew.

1223
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:19,840
Join me.

1224
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:21,720
Right away, buddy.

1225
01:23:23,320 --> 01:23:25,440
-Can I come over too?
-No.

1226
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:27,400
James, you just stay there.

1227
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:03,480
James...

1228
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:05,360
Just stay here, okay?

1229
01:24:06,520 --> 01:24:08,280
I have to go, buddy.

1230
01:24:09,320 --> 01:24:10,200
Bye.

1231
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:13,680
Take care, James, my buddy.

1232
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:26,320
You can enter...

1233
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:28,560
What a smart cookie.

1234
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:31,560
Why did you stop?

1235
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,800
Biew! Biew!

1236
01:24:39,880 --> 01:24:42,360
James! Go inside! Go back inside!

1237
01:24:51,080 --> 01:24:52,240
What do we do now?

1238
01:25:03,320 --> 01:25:04,400
What do we do?

1239
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:10,240
You want to haunt us?

1240
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:19,160
That'll teach you. Biew. James. Let's go.

1241
01:25:29,160 --> 01:25:31,680
Nick! Wait for me! Nick!

1242
01:25:38,040 --> 01:25:39,960
Master, watch your steps.

1243
01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:42,840
Watch your steps, master.

1244
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:45,120
Careful.

1245
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:54,000
Master.

1246
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:56,840
Nak's grave is on this side.

1247
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:07,400
Mak!

1248
01:26:08,040 --> 01:26:09,080
Mak.

1249
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,880
We don't need to fear anymore.
Nak can't follow us anymore.

1250
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:15,400
We've tied her up at the chapel.

1251
01:26:15,640 --> 01:26:16,560
It's true.

1252
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:20,160
M... M...

1253
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:24,200
M... Mae Nak!

1254
01:26:29,680 --> 01:26:31,120
How did she get here?

1255
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:50,920
Stop. Stop. No more chanting.

1256
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:53,800
Nak.

1257
01:26:55,240 --> 01:26:56,800
It's not that I'm scared of you...

1258
01:26:57,360 --> 01:27:00,840
but you are a ghost. Why entangle yourself
with human affairs?

1259
01:27:01,200 --> 01:27:04,400
You are a monk.
Why don't you mind your own monk business?

1260
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:06,320
Do not intrude into my marriage!

1261
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:07,400
Nak.

1262
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:08,760
Watch your mouth.

1263
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:10,000
Or do you want to scrap?

1264
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:13,280
I do not have any sap.
Can you speak clearly?

1265
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:15,040
I said scrap!

1266
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:16,000
Scrap...

1267
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:18,920
Or do you want to boink?

1268
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:20,280
Boink?

1269
01:27:21,560 --> 01:27:22,960
What does "boink" mean?

1270
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:24,560
Ask the person next to you!

1271
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:28,560
What does "boink" mean?

1272
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,360
-Also "scrap."
-To bump.

1273
01:27:32,440 --> 01:27:35,840
If you need to take a dump
then just go on the cross beam!

1274
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:37,280
-No, it's "bump."
-Bump?

1275
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:42,760
Nak.

1276
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:45,320
-You are being insolent.
-Buzz off!

1277
01:27:45,640 --> 01:27:50,480
I am not trying to intrude...
but your husband dragged me into this.

1278
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:52,760
You like to poke your nose
into people's affairs!

1279
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,600
I will kill everyone here!

1280
01:27:56,360 --> 01:27:57,760
Everyone?

1281
01:27:58,400 --> 01:27:59,880
Luang Por! Luang Por!

1282
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:02,440
Sire Luang Por.

1283
01:28:02,520 --> 01:28:05,000
Kham brought a ghost hunter
to Nak's grave.

1284
01:28:06,160 --> 01:28:07,360
She is gone.

1285
01:28:14,280 --> 01:28:16,040
Ghost of Nak is very powerful.

1286
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:21,600
Kham! Do you know
who Nak loves the most?

1287
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:22,680
Mak.

1288
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:25,400
Anyone else?

1289
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:28,160
And her child.

1290
01:28:29,720 --> 01:28:32,280
Hurry to her home and bring her child.

1291
01:28:32,680 --> 01:28:33,840
If he resists...

1292
01:28:38,840 --> 01:28:40,640
put this amulet around his neck.

1293
01:28:43,800 --> 01:28:46,200
The rest of you dig up Nak's corpse!

1294
01:28:47,320 --> 01:28:48,480
Come on. Hurry up.

1295
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:50,840
James. Hurry up, moron.

1296
01:28:51,320 --> 01:28:52,240
Tong.

1297
01:28:53,480 --> 01:28:54,800
Where is my wife?

1298
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:57,280
She is over there.

1299
01:28:58,520 --> 01:29:00,120
Why have you stopped?

1300
01:29:00,680 --> 01:29:02,760
Mak asked me a question, Luang Por.

1301
01:29:02,840 --> 01:29:04,240
Speed up.

1302
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:06,760
Luang Por!

1303
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:08,160
What is it?

1304
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:09,240
Wrong way, sire.

1305
01:29:11,320 --> 01:29:13,120
Then lead the way.
We're wasting time.

1306
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:14,480
Come or we will be late.

1307
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:16,320
Hurry up, guys. Come on.

1308
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:52,040
You are quite powerful for a little baby!

1309
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:10,240
Hurry up. Careful, James.

1310
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:12,960
Faster, novice...

1311
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:16,600
-or we will be too late.
-Yes, sire.

1312
01:30:45,320 --> 01:30:47,040
Hurry up. Follow me.

1313
01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:48,240
There they are.

1314
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:52,400
-Nak...
-Where?

1315
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:54,200
-Dang, my son!
-Mak!

1316
01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:57,240
-Mak!
-Hold this for me.

1317
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:02,480
Where is everyone? Where have they gone?

1318
01:31:03,680 --> 01:31:05,760
Luang Por! Are you okay?

1319
01:31:12,720 --> 01:31:14,320
Dang, my son!

1320
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:15,560
Kham, how dare you!

1321
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:17,480
Dang, my son!

1322
01:31:20,640 --> 01:31:21,920
-Mak!
-Stay way!

1323
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:31,240
Perhaps we need to cast a spell.
All of you chant the salutation thrice...

1324
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,560
to send her our thoughts a prayers. Quick!

1325
01:31:41,640 --> 01:31:42,560
Wait!

1326
01:31:44,920 --> 01:31:47,520
I really want to know where you are from.

1327
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:50,800
From an election, sire!

1328
01:31:55,400 --> 01:31:56,920
You want to challenge me, Nak?

1329
01:32:09,960 --> 01:32:13,040
-I cannot take this any more.
-Where are you going, Luang Por?

1330
01:32:26,600 --> 01:32:28,720
-We're actually playing rough?
-Yes.

1331
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:29,680
Fine!

1332
01:32:30,240 --> 01:32:31,240
I can play rough.

1333
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:37,760
Come at me, bro!

1334
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:41,440
Come at me!

1335
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:44,760
-Brian!
-Net!

1336
01:32:46,920 --> 01:32:48,160
Thanks, babe.

1337
01:32:48,600 --> 01:32:51,200
-You!
-Double-trouble!

1338
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:52,920
Brian, let's go.

1339
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:55,240
-Piggyback ride?
-Yes.

1340
01:32:59,640 --> 01:33:02,120
Both of you can go to hell!

1341
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:07,720
You think that someone like you
can save Nak?

1342
01:33:13,240 --> 01:33:14,720
Nak!

1343
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:27,200
Kham, let me go!

1344
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:28,840
Mak!

1345
01:34:00,120 --> 01:34:01,040
Nak.

1346
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:02,840
Mak!

1347
01:35:04,240 --> 01:35:05,080
Mak!

1348
01:35:05,800 --> 01:35:07,080
Can you hear me?

1349
01:35:07,880 --> 01:35:09,120
Come out!

1350
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:15,240
If no one is home, burn it all down!

1351
01:35:15,320 --> 01:35:16,840
Burn it! Burn it!

1352
01:35:16,920 --> 01:35:17,880
Burn it!

1353
01:35:17,960 --> 01:35:19,400
Burn it! Burn it!

1354
01:35:20,680 --> 01:35:21,840
Go on! Burn it!

1355
01:35:39,680 --> 01:35:41,960
I have done nothing to you!

1356
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:44,880
Why must you intrude into my affairs?

1357
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:47,360
Nak, you are a ghost!

1358
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:50,800
You intrude into human affairs.
You have killed people.

1359
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:53,120
Today, I will burn your house
to the ground.

1360
01:35:54,920 --> 01:35:56,760
Burn it! Burn it!

1361
01:35:57,920 --> 01:36:01,600
I live with my son and my husband!
I have never taken a life!

1362
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,160
But you bastards...

1363
01:36:03,240 --> 01:36:05,880
want to take my son and my husband
away from me!

1364
01:36:06,160 --> 01:36:08,760
Today, you have come
to burn down my house!

1365
01:36:09,480 --> 01:36:11,240
If I cannot live in peace...

1366
01:36:11,920 --> 01:36:15,040
then from now on, neither will any of you!

1367
01:36:53,800 --> 01:36:58,160
-Stop right here, novice.
-Yes, sire.

1368
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:14,240
Oh, Nak...

1369
01:37:16,200 --> 01:37:18,320
You should not have left me so soon.

1370
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:22,680
Don't sulk, Mak.
She's in a better place now.

1371
01:37:32,200 --> 01:37:33,600
Oh, Nak...

1372
01:37:53,720 --> 01:37:54,760
Mak.

1373
01:37:55,520 --> 01:37:56,600
The venerable monk

1374
01:37:56,680 --> 01:38:00,400
would like all of you to back away
from this place at this moment.

1375
01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:03,400
No one may enter until he has finished.

1376
01:38:04,080 --> 01:38:04,920
Yes, sire.

1377
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:11,200
Laywoman...

1378
01:38:12,360 --> 01:38:15,040
get up and talk to me.

1379
01:38:51,200 --> 01:38:52,440
Laywoman Nak...

1380
01:38:53,200 --> 01:38:56,640
Why have you attacked people like that?

1381
01:38:57,760 --> 01:38:59,920
I have not attacked anyone first.

1382
01:39:02,040 --> 01:39:04,600
But they bullied me and Dang first.

1383
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:07,960
Dang is only a small child...

1384
01:39:09,080 --> 01:39:11,080
yet they heartlessly hurt him.

1385
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:14,800
They have also burned down my house.

1386
01:39:17,320 --> 01:39:19,640
I only wish to be with my husband.

1387
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:24,200
I never wanted to harm anyone.

1388
01:39:25,880 --> 01:39:28,440
You have accumulated a very bad karma.

1389
01:39:30,600 --> 01:39:33,240
You cannot live with humans.

1390
01:39:38,160 --> 01:39:39,000
Novice.

1391
01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:40,440
Yes, sire.

1392
01:39:49,640 --> 01:39:53,160
Layman Mak,
the venerable monk wants you to enter.

1393
01:39:54,440 --> 01:39:55,440
Yes, sire.

1394
01:40:05,680 --> 01:40:06,800
Nak...

1395
01:40:12,480 --> 01:40:13,440
Nak...

1396
01:40:15,320 --> 01:40:16,400
Dang...

1397
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:18,040
Oh, Mak...

1398
01:40:20,280 --> 01:40:24,880
From now on, I will not be able to stay
and care for you.

1399
01:40:28,880 --> 01:40:31,680
Dang and I are ill-fated.

1400
01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:38,520
Though death may do us part...

1401
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:44,200
it could not take away my love for you.

1402
01:40:52,480 --> 01:40:55,080
Dang and I must say goodbye to you now.

1403
01:40:59,440 --> 01:41:02,360
I must go meditate with the venerable...

1404
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:06,920
until my bad karma has been eliminated.

1405
01:41:12,520 --> 01:41:13,920
Oh, Nak...

1406
01:41:16,720 --> 01:41:17,880
This lifetime...

1407
01:41:19,360 --> 01:41:23,360
the two of us must have
very little merit together...

1408
01:41:26,040 --> 01:41:28,000
so our time together was short.

1409
01:41:30,640 --> 01:41:31,840
In the next life...

1410
01:41:34,040 --> 01:41:36,600
we must be man and wife again, Nak.

1411
01:41:49,120 --> 01:41:50,120
Nak...

1412
01:41:57,680 --> 01:42:01,080
Layman Mak, please go. It's time.

1413
01:42:11,680 --> 01:42:14,320
-Mak...
-Nak...

1414
01:42:18,280 --> 01:42:19,200
Mak...

1415
01:42:23,880 --> 01:42:25,080
Mak...

1416
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:28,240
<i>I must go soon.</i>

1417
01:42:30,200 --> 01:42:31,600
Take care of yourself.

1418
01:42:33,960 --> 01:42:36,480
You as well, Mak.

1419
01:42:40,920 --> 01:42:42,360
<i>You must not cry.</i>

1420
01:42:43,520 --> 01:42:45,480
<i>I will take good care of myself.</i>

1421
01:42:59,480 --> 01:43:00,800
Mak...

1422
01:43:02,720 --> 01:43:04,360
Take care of yourself!

1423
01:43:06,720 --> 01:43:08,200
<i>I will return soon!</i>

1424
01:43:21,360 --> 01:43:24,920
Layman Mak must also come with me.

1425
01:43:26,880 --> 01:43:28,240
Why so, Luang Por?

1426
01:43:28,760 --> 01:43:29,680
Novice.

1427
01:43:31,080 --> 01:43:32,040
Yes, sire.

1428
01:43:40,680 --> 01:43:42,400
Come, help me, please.

1429
01:43:46,720 --> 01:43:48,480
Tong. Oil. Go help.

1430
01:43:49,040 --> 01:43:49,960
Go on.

1431
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:16,320
Do you remember nothing?

1432
01:44:18,080 --> 01:44:21,120
Look back at all the events.

1433
01:44:26,840 --> 01:44:29,800
I am here to bid you goodbye
before going to war.

1434
01:44:32,240 --> 01:44:34,480
Take good care of yourself.

1435
01:44:36,680 --> 01:44:41,000
From this moment on,
karma will lead your destiny.

1436
01:44:42,600 --> 01:44:45,160
No one may change it.

1437
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:57,960
<i>Mak...</i>

1438
01:44:59,360 --> 01:45:01,520
<i>if you wish to know the truth...</i>

1439
01:45:02,680 --> 01:45:06,800
<i>make a wish and think of the Buddha...</i>

1440
01:45:07,440 --> 01:45:10,560
then look in between your legs...

1441
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,560
and you will see the truth.

1442
01:45:23,280 --> 01:45:25,960
Am I dead, venerable monk?

1443
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:35,440
Are you not aware that ghosts
and humans cannot live together?

1444
01:45:54,880 --> 01:45:56,200
That's Mak.

1445
01:45:56,920 --> 01:45:59,040
-He really is dead.
-When did he die?

1446
01:46:06,120 --> 01:46:09,040
Nick... Mak really is dead.

1447
01:46:12,440 --> 01:46:13,480
Nak.

1448
01:46:15,800 --> 01:46:16,800
Nak.

1449
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:34,960
Let's go. Let's go, quick.

1450
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:44,440
Mae Nak.

1451
01:46:48,240 --> 01:46:49,160
What is it?

1452
01:46:50,120 --> 01:46:54,840
We apologize for disrespecting you...

1453
01:46:55,480 --> 01:46:59,080
and for not believing
in your love for Mak.

1454
01:46:59,160 --> 01:47:01,480
Please forgive us.

1455
01:47:03,200 --> 01:47:04,160
Please?

1456
01:47:04,720 --> 01:47:07,600
You shall travel safely to your homes.

1457
01:47:07,880 --> 01:47:08,720
Yes, ma'am.

1458
01:47:13,120 --> 01:47:13,960
Mae Nak.

1459
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:21,240
About my exams...
will you help me?

1460
01:47:22,720 --> 01:47:25,400
-Sure.
-Great.

1461
01:47:25,480 --> 01:47:28,960
All you have to do is study hard enough.

1462
01:47:30,080 --> 01:47:31,960
Man... Study hard.

1463
01:47:36,840 --> 01:47:37,720
Mae Nak.

1464
01:47:39,560 --> 01:47:40,560
Want a blanket?

1465
01:47:42,280 --> 01:47:43,280
Want a blanket?

1466
01:47:48,200 --> 01:47:49,040
Nick.

1467
01:47:50,440 --> 01:47:51,920
How are we getting home?

1468
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:56,320
-That's right.
-How are we getting home?

1469
01:47:56,800 --> 01:48:01,480
Nick, try asking Mae Nak.
Wake her up. Come on.

1470
01:48:02,520 --> 01:48:03,360
Mae Nak.

1471
01:48:04,720 --> 01:48:05,840
Mae Nak.

1472
01:48:08,640 --> 01:48:10,480
-Nothing.
-She won't wake up.

1473
01:48:10,760 --> 01:48:12,240
If she won't get up...

1474
01:48:12,400 --> 01:48:14,040
then how are we going home?

1475
01:48:15,240 --> 01:48:16,320
Good question.

1476
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:21,520
Luang Por, please take us home.

1477
01:48:22,680 --> 01:48:25,520
Do you remember nothing?

1478
01:48:28,560 --> 01:48:31,960
-Where did we come from?
-Good question.

1479
01:48:33,080 --> 01:48:35,600
From the port in front of Mae Nak's house.

1480
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:38,760
-Port?
-Oh!

1481
01:48:40,840 --> 01:48:43,280
Let's go home!

1482
01:48:49,760 --> 01:48:50,920
Let's go home!

1483
01:48:56,120 --> 01:48:57,480

-Yes.
-Pulling my leg.

1528
01:52:34,400 --> 01:52:35,760
What van is this?

1529
01:52:38,440 --> 01:52:40,720
He peed on me.

1530

New Phra Khanong.

01:52:56,360 --> 01:52:58,360
All right, all right. Okay.

Last night, Prig lied about me.

1540
01:53:20,600 --> 01:53:22,440
-Again. Again.
-Whatever.

1541
01:53:22,760 --> 01:53:24,400

But last night, Prig lied to me that...

01:53:35,760 --> 01:53:36,960
But last night, Prig...

1547
01:53:40,680 --> 01:53:43,840
How can you just resay it?

1548
01:53:44,800 --> 01:53:46,000
How will they cut it?

1549
01:53:46,840 --> 01:53:48,280
We're doing behind the scenes.

1550

I'm not trying to intrude.

1551
01:53:49,640 --> 01:53:50,880
I'm not trying to intrude.

1552
01:53:50,960 --> 01:53:53,840
I am not trying to intrude.
Your husband did. Action.

"Am not."

1557
01:54:00,600 --> 01:54:03,000
I'm not trying to intrude.
I'm not trying to intrude.

1558
01:54:03,080 --> 01:54:04,920
Am not. I am not trying to intrude...

1559

1563
01:54:16,200 --> 01:54:19,200
dragged it to me... Dragged me into this.

1564
01:54:19,480 --> 01:54:22,520
I'm not trying to intrude...
but your husband dragged me into this.

1565
01:54:22,600 --> 01:54:23,440
Action.

1566
01:54:23,520 --> 01:54:28,040

1568
01:54:29,920 --> 01:54:31,360
Wait. Cut. Cut.

1569
01:54:31,920 --> 01:54:32,800
Let's not shoot.

1570
01:54:32,880 --> 01:54:34,360
Last night must have been rough.
